				<p>I am a computer engineering student at the University of Southern California. I originally studied at Biola University
				as a part of the 3+2 program. At the end of the program, I will have a BS in 
				Engineering-Phyics and a minor in Bible from Biola, and a BS in Computer Engineering
				and Computer Science with an emphasis in embedded systems from USC.
				</p>
				<p>At Biola, I finished with a 4.0 GPA. I was a teaching assistant for six classes and involved in two major
				on-campus research projects, resulting in two publications.

				<p>My professoinal engineering career began when I interned at Boeing Huntington Beach during the summer of 2016.
				I was an electrical engineering intern and was mentored by
				a senior Boeing electrical engineer. It was a great experience 
				and began my passion for engineering. I worked on many amazing projects 
				that made me excited to go to work every day. Among my responsibilities, I helped my mentor test circuit boards
				for the Space Launch System (SLS) program, I helped organize a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) 
				for the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) program, and I used my computer science knowledge to 
				add features to a company-specific lab report program written in C#.</p>
				<p>During the summer of 2017, I was invited back to Boeing Huntington Beach to participate
				in the BEAM program, which is an externship where I was able to network, learn about Boeing and
				engineering careers, and compete in several team design challenges. The program was populated by
				a small group of underclassmen applicants from local universities, as well as a few former interns
				that were invited back after the previous summer. I was very happy to be invited back to such
				a select program and had an amazing time continuing to explore engineering.</p>

				<p>For the first half of the summer of 2018, I was hired by Biola's engnineering department
				to participate in research. I was chosen to work alongside a Biology professor to create
				a system to control Biola's Organic Garden. You can read more about the project on my research 
				page (<a href="research.html">here</a>).</p>
				<p>For the second half of the summer of 2018, I was hired by Pioneer Circuits Inc. as an engineering
				intern. I worked alongside the engineering department to improve efficiency and organization.
				I was tasked with performing data analysis to adjust the scales used in producing boards, and
				I was able to improve size accuracy by 50%. I also created and organized a database of engineering specification
				documents necessary for the production and quality assurance of circuit boards.</p>

				<p>In the summer of 2019, I worked as a software engineering intern at Liferay, Inc.
				Liferay produces an open-source digital experience platform. As an intern, I received extensive training Java/JSP back-end development and in 
				Liferay's DXP Cloud. After completing my training, I was assigned to work on portlets for an internal department database portal.
				I developed a custom CSV import portlet which is used to perform a weekly database update of the department's clients and projects.
				Also, I added features to a custom full-stack staff display portlet for the database's GUI. My internship taught me how to work as a team to 
				write software using Github, code reviews, and AGILE development. After completing my internship, I received a
				return offer to intern during the summer of 2020, but, unfortunately, it was canceled due to COVID-19.</p>

				<p>In 2017, I graduated from Brea Olinda High School (BOHS). I was valedictorian with a 4.63 GPA. 
				I also received the National AP Scholar award; I took 12 AP tests and received a 5
				on all of them, highlighted by AP Calculus BC, AP Computer Science, AP Physics 1, and AP Physics 2.
				At BOHS, I was a part of the Global Information Technology Academy (GITA) program, 
				which is a track of computer science courses. I took three years of computer programming in high school through this program,
				becoming proficient in C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Java.<br><br>
				At BOHS, I was involved in the National Honor Society (NHS) for two years. I was also a part of Link 
				Crew for two years, which is a program where upperclassmen mentor freshmen. I also volunteered
				at EV Free Fullerton, Surfriders, and other organizations around Brea. For my community service,
				I received the Brea Mayor's Youth Award when I graduated. During high school, I discovered my 
				passion for math, physics, and computer programming, which is why I am now studying engineering.</p>

				<p>Outside of school, I am a very big fan of soccer. I played for nine years, 
				including two in high school, before I quit to focus on academics. Even though 
				I've quit playing for an organized team, I still play soccer regularly. I was
				born in Barcelona, Spain, so my favorite team is FC Barcelona as I consider them
				my hometown team. I also enjoy rooting for the Spanish national team in major 
				international tournaments. I 
				watch every Barca game, as well as other major games that I have time for,
				which has greatly diminished now that I am in college.
				Soccer is another one of my passions and I hope to be a coach of some level someday.
				</p>
				<p>Also, I am a big fan being active. I play volleyball, soccer, basketball, and ultimate frisbee.
				I also enjoy lifting weights and hiking. Some of the pictures used on this website were taken by me on hikes.
