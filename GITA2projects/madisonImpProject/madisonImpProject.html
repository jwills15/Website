		<dt>Ashley Madison Facts:</dt>
			<dd>Ashely Madison was a site for having affairs with over
				40 million users. They prided themselves on security
				and the ability to enable affairs without consequences.</dd>
		<dt>The Hack</dt>
			<dd>A group called "The Impact Team" hacked Ashley Madison in
			July 2015, and threatened to release the data unless the website
			was shut down. When this did not happen, on August 18 the hackers released
			over 60 gigabytes of user and company data on the dark web,
			which eventually made its way onto the open web.</dd>
		<dt>The Aftermath</dt>
			<dd>Ashley Madison still remains online, but is no longer trusted
			by users. The CEO of the company was forced out after the hack,
			and the hackers are being pursued by legal authorities.</dd>

		<h2>What are the consequences for users of Ashley Madison?</h2>
			<p>Web developers created a website to find if a person had used
			Ashley Madison, simply by entering the person's name and email address.
			This has revealed many people who cheated on their spouse, and has
			caused several suicides. Credit card information was also released,
			along with passwords of users, which showed that most passwords were
			"123456" or "password," which are very easy to break.</p>
