				<p>My name is Joshua Williams and I am an engineering student at Biola University.
				I love computers and electronics, and I plan on going into electrical engineering with
				a computer emphasis. Here at Biola, there is no full engineering degree, but I am 
				a part of the 3+2 program, which is a partnership with the University of Southern
				California (USC). I will study here at Biola for 3 years, and then I will transfer to USC 
				to finish my engineering degree. At the end of the program, I plan to have a BS in 
				Engineering-Phyics and a minor in Bible from Biola, and I a BS in Electrical Engineering
				with a computer emphasis from USC.

				<p>In 2017 I graduated from Brea Olinda High School (BOHS), where I was valedictorian with a 4.63 GPA. 
				I also received the National AP Scholar award because I took 12 AP tests and received a 5
				on all of them, highlighted by AP Calculus BC, AP Computer Science, AP Physics 1, and AP Physics 2.
				At BOHS, I was a part of the Global Information Technology Academy (GITA) program, 
				which is a program for the top students at BOHS and teaches computer 
				programming. I took three years of computer programming in high school through this program,
				and I learned C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Java.
				At BOHS, I was involved in the National Honor Society (NHS) for two years and a part of Link 
				Crew for two years, which is a program where upperclassmen mentor freshmen. I also volunteered
				at EV Free Fullerton, Surfriders, and other organizations around Brea. For my community service,
				I received the Brea Mayor's Youth Award when I graduated. During high school, I discovered my 
				passion for math, physics, and computer programming, which is why I am now studying engineering.</p>

				<p>I have had the privilege of interning at Boeing Huntington Beach during the summer of 2016.
				I was able to work as an electrical engineering intern and was mentored by
				a Boeing electrical engineer. It was a great experience 
				and I was able to know for sure that I wanted to go into engineering, specifically 
				electrical engineering. I worked on many amazing projects and saw that I could make a career
				out of electrical engineering. Among my responsibilities, I helped my mentor test circuit boards
				for the Space Launch System (SLS) program, I helped organize a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) 
				for the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) program, and I used my computer science knowledge to 
				add features to a company-specificcomputer program written in C#. I thoroughly enjoyed my summer 
				there and knew what that I wanted to go into electrical engineering.</p>

				<p>During the summer of 2017, I was invited back to Boeing Huntington Beach to participate
				in the BEAM program, which is an externship where I was able to network, learn about Boeing and
				engineering careers, and compete in several team design challenges. The program was populated by
				a small group of underclassmen applicants from local universities, as well as a few former interns
				that were invited back after the previous summer. I was very happy to be invited back to such
				a select program and had an amazing time continuing to explore engineering and affirming my
				plans to go into electrical engineering.</p>

				<p>Outside of school, I am a very big fan of soccer. I played for nine years, 
				including two in high school, before I quit to focus on academics. Even though 
				I've quit playing for an organized team, I still follow soccer regularly. I was
				born in Barcelona, Spain, so my favorite team is FC Barcelona as I consider them
				my hometown team. I also enjoy rooting for the Spanish national team in major 
				international tournaments. I 
				watch every Barca game, as well as other major games that I have time for,
				which has greatly diminished now that I am in college.
				Soccer is another one of my passions and I hope to be a coach of some level someday.
				I still enjoy playing the game when I get the chance to, 
				even though I am not as good as I used to be.</p>
