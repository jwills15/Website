		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<div class="texts">
			This website was created by the GITA 2 students of Brea Olinda High School. GITA is a special 
			program at BOHS that allows students to gain experience and understanding 
			of computer science with direct teaching of several computer science languages 
			over four years and with preparation for the AP Computer Science test. Through 
			this stress relief website, we strive to see what exactly causes stress for 
			BOHS students and attempt to help students relieve it. We want to make BOHS 
			a better place while also furthering our understanding and knowledge of the 
			creation and running of websites, such as this one. This website was coded 
			by us with the skills we have learned in GITA 2, which teaches HTML, CSS, 
			and Javascript, which are used for website development.

			Our mission is to help students understand more about their stress levels by 
			asking specific questions and displaying visual graphics to help represent 
			stress. This website also includes tips and advice from professional sources, 
			as well as teachers, counselors, and top-in-their-class peers, in order to help 
			students recognize and alleviate stress. We also provide methods for students 
			to contact their counselors if they have further issues.
